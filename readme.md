@group: good morning team.  I’m sure Joe is talking you through this last group project that you’ll be doing.  Here’s my notes for you.

1. Remember to design first. Apply the 70/30 rule.
2. Use Trello and write acceptance criteria for every, single feature.
3. Use Moqups to create wireframes
4. Agree on a feature branch naming strategy.
5. Create a feature branch for everything you do.

You will be presenting your finished project on December 2nd.  After that, capstone projects start
